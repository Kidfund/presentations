# Kidfund Backlog

### AKA Q1-Q2 Priorities

---

# So, what do we have?

* Iteration
* New Features
* Technical Debt

---

# Iteration

* Making **existing** things **BETTER** to increase customer delight and reduce support requests / complaints. Happier users will recommend the app **more**.
* Fixing **bugs**. Some users can see, some they can't

---

# New Features

Both small and big

*Examples*

* Small: Features to make telling people about Kidfund easier
* Big: Redo Onboarding, [redacted]
* Bigger: *You know*, **build the website**

---

# Technical Debt

---

# Technical Debt

* Automated Tests: Wouldn't it be **great** if we could push a new version of the app out every 1-3 weeks? (And make new builds of the app & backend **less dangerous**)
* Leads to: **Less manual testing**
* Improve Infrastructure - Make deploys faster and safer. Additional prep for scale

---

# So, what's the plan?

1. Focus on priority iteration and stability tickets
2. Sprinkle in new features that directly effect growth or re-use
3. 50% Build (#1 and #2) / 50% Paying off Technical debt

Then,

4. MOAR NEW FEATURES

# The care and pruning of a good backlog

Process Update:

Our backlog has grown to the point where managing it is time consuming

---

# Backlog will be split:

* "App" (existing) will remain and contain prioritized tickets (what we've talked about today)
* "Inbox" will contain everything else
    * Every NEW ticket, with the exception of crashes, goes here
* Inbox & App will be pruned & re-prioritized roughly once a month (to start)

---

# The care and pruning of a good backlog

Why?

* Easier to manage day to day (less cognitive load)
* Will make prioritizing new ticket's easier: *Is it REALLY more important than the shorter prioritized list?*
